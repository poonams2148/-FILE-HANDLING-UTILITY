DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK:
Task Description: File Handling Utility in Java
File handling is an essential aspect of programming that enables developers to interact with files on a storage system. Java provides robust APIs for reading, writing, and modifying text files, making it a preferred language for creating utility programs to manage file operations. In this task, the goal is to design and implement a Java program that demonstrates basic file handling operations. This includes creating, reading, writing, and modifying text files while adhering to good programming practices and providing clear documentation.

Objective
The primary objective of this task is to gain a practical understanding of Java’s file handling capabilities. The program will showcase how developers can manage file input and output operations effectively while ensuring proper error handling, resource management, and code clarity. The utility program will serve as a foundational tool for performing common file operations and can be extended for more advanced use cases.

Scope of the Task
The program will demonstrate the following key operations:

Reading Files: The ability to open and read the content of an existing text file. This is useful for analyzing or processing stored data.
Writing to Files: The capability to create new files and write data into them. This operation will highlight appending text to an existing file as well.
Modifying Files: Allowing changes to the contents of an existing file, which involves reading, updating, and saving data back to the file.
Error Handling: Managing scenarios like file not found, insufficient permissions, and input/output errors gracefully.
Documentation: Providing comprehensive comments and a user-friendly interface for better understanding and usability of the program.
Deliverables
A complete and functional Java program is required. The script will:

Create a new text file or open an existing one.
Allow the user to write or append content to the file.
Enable the user to read and view the file's content.
Provide functionality to modify specific lines or content within the file.
Be well-documented, with comments explaining the logic and purpose of each code segment.
Importance of File Handling
File handling utilities are integral to applications that deal with data persistence. For example:

Configuration files in software store settings and preferences.
Log files record system activities and errors.
Data processing scripts read large datasets from files for analysis.
User-generated content, like reports and text entries, is often saved to files.
The ability to work with files effectively empowers developers to build scalable and maintainable software systems. This task not only provides hands-on experience with Java file handling but also helps in understanding the importance of structured data storage and manipulation.

Approach and Implementation
Planning: Break down the task into logical steps such as creating methods for reading, writing, and modifying files.
Code Design: Implement the logic using Java's File, FileWriter, FileReader, and BufferedReader classes for efficient file operations.
Testing: Validate the program with different scenarios, such as working with large files, empty files, and files with special characters.
Documentation: Add comments in the code to explain the functionality of each part and create a README file describing how to use the program.
By the end of this task, the utility will provide a reusable script for file operations and serve as a learning resource for understanding Java’s file handling capabilities.
